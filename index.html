<h1>Hello World - This is a Git test!</h1>

<p>I'd just like to wax-lyrical about Git and how it does it's thang</p>

<h2>Git Todo:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Look into Git author name</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to...</h2>

<h3>Have Git ignore folders/files from a repo</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Remove/Untrack folders/files from repo that should be ignored by Git<br>
		<em>Git can only ignore untracked files</em>
		<pre>git rm [folder/filename]</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Check Git status to confirm which folders/files will be deleted upon commit
		<pre>git status</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Commit changes (removing folders/files from repo) (NB: '-a' will commit all folders/files effected)
		<pre>git commit -a -m "description of what has changed in commit"</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Create a '.gitignore' file in repo directory</li>
	<li>add folders/filenames to ignore into .gitignore (example .gitignore file below)
		<pre>.DS_Store<br>system/</pre>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Branching</h3>
<ul>
	<li>to get a list of branches in repo (currently checked-out branch will be highlighted with *)
		<pre>git branch</pre>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Creating new branches</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Create new branch in repo (branch names cannot have spaces in)
		<pre>git branch [branch-name]</pre>
		new branch is based on currently checked-out branch at the time of creation
	</li>
	<li>checkout new branch to start working with it
		<pre>git checkout [branch-name]</pre>
	</li>
	<li>work on files in new branch</li>
	<li>commit changes in new branch as normal</li>
	<li>once happy with work in branch... switch back to previous (parent) branch
		<pre>git checkout [branch-name]</pre>
	</li>
	<li>merge new branch into previous (parent) branch
		<pre>git merge [branch-name]</pre>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>Conflicts (between branches)</h4>
<ul>
	<li>when changes occur on 2 branches before they've been merged</li>
	<li>when a merge is attempted in this scenario Git will fail to merge<br>
		and add both sections of code will be added into the current branch files from the other branch where changes have taken place. (example file after conflicts)
		<pre>... <br><br><<<<<<< [current branch-name] <br>   [code from current branch] <br>======== <br>   [code from other branch] <br>>>>>> [other branch-name] <br><br>...</pre>
