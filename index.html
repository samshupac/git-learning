<h1>Hello World - This is a Git test!</h1>

<p>I'd just like to wax-lyrical about Git and how it does it's thang</p>

<h2>Git Todo:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Look into Git author name</li>
	<li>public/private keys for push to remote over SSH</li>
</ul>

<h2>Commands Quick Guide</h2>
<ul>
	<li>find out the status of the current (checked-out) branch in repo
		<pre>git status</pre>
	</li>
	<li>show the commit log
		<pre>git log</pre>
		<pre>git log -[number of log items to show]</pre>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to...</h2>

<h3>Have Git ignore folders/files from a repo</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Remove/Untrack folders/files from repo that should be ignored by Git<br>
		<em>Git can only ignore untracked files</em>
		<pre>git rm [folder/filename]</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Check Git status to confirm which folders/files will be deleted upon commit
		<pre>git status</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Commit changes (removing folders/files from repo) (NB: '-a' will commit all folders/files effected)
		<pre>git commit -a -m "description of what has changed in commit"</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Create a '.gitignore' file in repo directory</li>
	<li>add folders/filenames to ignore into .gitignore (example .gitignore file below)
		<pre>.DS_Store<br>system/</pre>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Branching</h3>
<ul>
	<li>to get a list of branches in repo (currently checked-out branch will be highlighted with *)
		<pre>git branch</pre>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Creating new branches</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Create new branch in repo (branch names cannot have spaces in)
		<pre>git branch [branch-name]</pre>
		new branch is based on currently checked-out branch at the time of creation
	</li>
	<li>checkout new branch to start working with it
		<pre>git checkout [branch-name]</pre>
	</li>
	<li>work on files in new branch</li>
	<li>commit changes in new branch as normal</li>
	<li>once happy with work in branch... switch back to previous (parent) branch
		<pre>git checkout [branch-name]</pre>
	</li>
	<li>merge new branch into previous (parent) branch
		<pre>git merge [branch-name]</pre>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>Conflicts (between branches)</h4>
<ul>
	<li>when changes occur on 2 branches before they've been merged</li>
	<li>when a merge is attempted in this scenario Git will fail to merge<br>
		and add both sections of code will be added into the current branch files from the other branch where changes have taken place. (example file after conflicts)
		<pre>... <br><br><<<<<<< [current branch-name] <br>   [code from current branch] <br>======== <br>   [code from other branch] <br>>>>>> [other branch-name] <br><br>...</pre>
	</li>
</ul>
<h5>To resolve a conflict</h5>
<ol>
	<li>after trying to merge branches and file is at the point mentioned above...</li>
	<li>commit fixes into current branch as normal
		<pre>git commit -a -m "[useful commit message]"</pre>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Stashes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>a way to take some things you've been working on (changes you've made) and temporarily store them or (stash them somewhere), go work on something else and then you can restore them later and start back where you were and it'll pull those changes.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>whilst making changes in a branch as normal, but not ready to commit those changes</li>
	<li>create a stash to temporary store those uncommited changes
		<pre>git stash</pre>
	</li>
	<li>show stashes
		<pre>git stash list</pre>
	</li>
	<li>make interim changes (e.g. perhaps a quick tweak to copy)</li>
	<li>commit interim changes to repo
		<pre>git commit -a -m "[useful commit message]"</pre>
	</li>
	<li>done with interim/emergency changes</li>
	<li>show stashes
		<pre>git stash list</pre>
	</li>
	<li>go back to a stash where you left off
		<pre>git stash apply</pre>
	</li>
	<li>upon finishing original changes, commit as usual</li>
</ol>
	
<h3>Remote Repos</h3>
<ul>
	<li>example with GitHub as remote Git server</li>
</ul>

<h4>Setup remote repo</h4>
<ol>
	<li>add a remote repo to a local repo so that commit can be pushed to remote
		<pre>git remote add [remote-repo-short-name] [url for remote repo]</pre>
		<em>remote repo short name - just a way to refer to the remote repo rather than using url everytime (often called 'origin')</em>
	</li>
	<li>list remote repos
		<pre>git remote</pre>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>Push to remote repo</h4>
<ol>
	<li>once commited changes (probably in master repo because thats where all deployed commits should be)</li>
	<li>push latest commit in current branch up to remote repo and specific remote branch
		<pre>git push [remote-repo-short-name] [remote-branch-name]</pre>
		<em>remote branch name - the branch you want to push to, likely to be 'master'</em><br>
		its also possible to push to <u>all</u> remote branches in a remote repo, if required
		<pre>git push [remote-repo-short-name] --all</pre>
	</li>
	<li>authentication! (can be done automatically if pushing over SSH with public/private keys)</li>
</ol>

<h4>Clone remote repo</h4>
<ol>
	<li>clone entire repo from remote
		<pre>git clone [url for remote repo] [local directory]</pre>
		<em>local directory - (a folder name) is relative to where cd is at the time</em>
	</li>
	<li>move into new directory that now contains clone of remote repo (not a Git command)
		<pre>cd [local directory]</pre>
	</li>
	<li>only the branches that were pushed to remote will come down using a clone (in above 'Push to remote repo' only the current branch was pushed to remote)</li>
	<li>after making changes, push back up to remote (as above)</li>
</ol>

<h4>To check what has changed on remote</h4>
<ol>
	<li>bring references up-to-date from remote server (probably 'origin' branch?), doesn't pull down the files
		<pre>git remote update</pre>
	</li>
	<li>to actually pull down the changes, see below</li>
</ol>

<h4>Pull down from remote repo</h4>
<ol>
	<li>pull down changes (and files) from remote repo and remote branch into a local branch
		<pre>git pull [remote-branch-name] [local-branch-name]</pre>
	</li>
</ol>
